# E-APO-Config-Switcher

A small Windows app that sits in the tray and allows you to quickly switch between using different [Equalizer APO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/) configuration files

Due to this being quite a niche app, several things are assumed:
- Equalizer APO is installed in `C:\Program Files\EqualizerAPO`
- This app will be installed in `C:\Program Files\EqualizerAPO\config\E-APO-Config-Switcher`
- You are not manually editing your Equalizer APO config.txt. if you do it *might* cause errors

## Credits

- [zserge/tray](https://github.com/zserge/tray) to handle the system tray interaction
- Inspired by [Peace](https://sourceforge.net/projects/peace-equalizer-apo-extension/)
